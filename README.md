# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my take on building a design from  https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-uO4ST1PmJ.

I've decided to build it using vanilla html,css and javascript to practice accessibility and new css properties.

It's deployed on https://adoring-noether-856c0b.netlify.app/
